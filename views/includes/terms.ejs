          These Terms of Service for European Users (<strong>“Terms”</strong>) are a binding legal agreement between you and Airbnb that govern your right to use the websites, applications, and other offerings from Airbnb (collectively, the <strong>“Airbnb Platform”</strong>). When used in these Terms, <strong>“Airbnb,” “we”, “us,”</strong> or <strong>“our”</strong> refers to the Airbnb entity set out on <a href="#" class="underline">Schedule 1</a> with whom you are contracting.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          The Airbnb Platform offers an online venue that enables users (<strong>“Members”</strong>) to publish, offer, search for, and book services. Members who publish and offer services are <strong>“Hosts”</strong> and Members who search for, book, or use services are <strong>“Guests.”</strong> Hosts offer accommodations (<strong>“Accommodations”</strong>), activities, excursions and events (<strong>“Experiences”</strong>), and a variety of travel and other services (collectively, <strong>“Host Services,”</strong> and each Host Service offering, a <strong>“Listing”</strong>). As the provider of the Airbnb Platform, Airbnb does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings, Host Services, or tourism services. Airbnb is not a party to the contracts entered into directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is Airbnb a real estate broker, travel agency, insurer or an organiser or retailer of travel packages under Directive (EU) 2015/2302. Airbnb is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the <a href="#" class="underline">Payments Terms of Service</a> (<strong>“Payment Terms”</strong>). To learn more about Airbnb’s role see Section 17.
